Please do not pull from this repository.

As of 20200219, Cado-NFS development is now at:

    https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs

To clone the Cado-NFS sources, do:

    git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs.git

or

    git clone git@gitlab.inria.fr:cado-nfs/cado-nfs.git

(use the latter if you have commit access).

If you have an existing git checkout, you must arrange so that it points
to the new location. There are three cases:

    case 1: you have no local commits and no pending changes
    case 2: you have uncommitted pending changes
    case 3: you have local commits that have not yet been pushed

Case 1, if you have no local commits and no pending changes, you can do:

    git pull    # from the old repo. presumably this is how you got this
                # file in the first place !
    git remote set-url origin https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs.git
    git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.inria.fr:cado-nfs/cado-nfs.git
                # choose one of the two lines above.
    git pull

Case 2, if you have uncommitted pending changes, a "git pull" will certainly
complain as follows:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
            CMakeLists.txt
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.

So you're bound to do what the comment says, and then you reach the next
situation.

Case 3, if you have local commits, a "git pull" will now *FAIL* with a conflict:

    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

You must then do

    git merge --abort
    git remote set-url origin https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs.git
    git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.inria.fr:cado-nfs/cado-nfs.git
                # choose one of the two lines above.
    git pull
    git push    # push your local commits, if appropriate.
