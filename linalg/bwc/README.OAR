For OAR, bwc.pl automatically recognizes the hostnames, thus there is no need
to supply hosts=...

For Open MPI v2.0.2, it might be necessary to add the following option to the
bwc.pl command line:

   mpi_extra_args='--mca mtl ofi --mca pml ob1'

Maybe also --mca btl openib and --mca btl_openib_allow_ib true.
